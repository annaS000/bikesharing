# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Overview
> This project looks at a large dataset collected from Citi Bike, specifically from NYC. This dataset provides information on customers such as Gender, Birth Year, Starting and Ending Stations, Start and Stop times, Usertype, Bike ID, etc. To analyze and display these variables we have used Tableau to create interactive visualizations and created a story for our targeted audience.

## Summary
Overall, based on the charts we have made in this analysis, Citi bikes seem to mostly be used during the times for commuting to and from work and late at night on the weekends. Thursday sees the biggest spike in activity.  Additionally, we can see that men typically use Citi bikes the most and have the most service subscriptions out of the three categories for gender. One idea that could be explored is that this could be a result of differences in clothing choices, NYC has many offices which have business attire dress codes as well as being known for having a busy nightlife especially on the weekends. It is common for women to wear a skirt or dress in an office setting or on a night out in NYC so, it is possible it may not be comfortable to ride a bike in these types of clothing. It would be an interesting addition to this analysis to collect data on the types of clothing Citi Bike customers wear throughout the week along with their occupations. It is understandable for weekends to have higher activity than weekdays because when people are off from work they can visit NYC since it is a major city with many attractions which can also increase the amount of tourists on those days.
